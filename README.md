# Codex_Test

- I took advantage of my recent background in Android development and decided to carry out the exercises on this platform. Here is the apk link: [(https://drive.google.com/file/d/19sjFiSa0V8-xBJceD0hgIrMpMePLxMIm/view?usp=sharing)]
- For the apk to work, depending on the Android device (in emulators this is not necessary), you will need to activate permission to install unknown applications or, if the "Application Blocked" message appears, you must use the "see more" function and "install anyway"

- Exercise 1 -> I made a small implementation of an algorithm to analyze CNPJ. There is no character limit, but if you enter the correct amount, an error message will be displayed. Valid for both the unformatted and formatted versions.
- Exercise 2 -> I learned about the intersection of rectangles. Here it will be necessary to use a pattern like: 3 5 11 11; 7 2 13 7; 11 11 15 13
Adding each number with space and, for each set of coordinates, separating with a ";". I apologize, I tried to improve this implementation, but unfortunately I wasted a lot of time and moved on to the next one. :(

- Exercise 3 -> Unfortunately, I wasn't able to go much further here. I tried to adapt a solution I found in Java to calculate the area of ​​intersections, but I couldn't. Here I still intend to study more about it, I found it very interesting.
- Exercise 4 -> A very simple To-Do application, using Firebase as a database.
- Exercise 5 -> I found some problems with this API, but I think it was part of the process, right? It takes a long time to return, sometimes showing error 503... Build an application that starts, displays a "Searching..." and, if there is an error, there will be more successful attempts. I also had problems getting the time, where I ended up making a mistake and leaving the offset as UTC time. :(
- Exercise 6 -> In this last exercise you will need to check in a browser. The android became a server, but I didn't have time to show status. It ended up being very simple, so access the information in a browser that is on the same network as your device, get the IP of your device (settings > name > status) and add the port :8080 (10.0.0.1:8080).
- Exercise 7 -> I apologize, the doc is simpler than it should be, but here it is. [(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zBsEH_Vp6jkWsO9ZW6SD4zWUrEcdiaH3OncbikmR7NM/edit?usp=sharing)]

Thanks for the opportunity.
